# Music-Streaming-application

This application is a music streaming application where the client module gets data from the server and displays it to the user.
Client and the Server must be run on the same computer and you can use Netbeans(What I used). Client and Server are two different processes
which should be run seperately(server first then client).Currently the communication network can send and recieve only login 
information butimplementing the music transfer would be the exact same process where slight changes would be made to both parties.
